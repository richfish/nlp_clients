# nlp_clients

A bunch of clients and helpers you might find useful for your NLP projects. You'll need to customize for your project, but it will get the ball rolling.

For the most part you'll have to download your own copies of PropBank, ConceptNet, Simplewiki, Oxford Collocations, SNLI, etc., but in some cases scrapers are provided.

Generally clients interact with data (assumed in /assets), while helpers are higher level interfaces.
